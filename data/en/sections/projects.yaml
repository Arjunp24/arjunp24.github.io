- name: Sentiment Analysis Web App
#   logo: /images/sections/projects/kubernetes.png
#   role: Contributor
  timeline: "May 2020"
  repo: https://github.com/Arjunp24/sentiment-analysis-sagemaker
  summary: ●Developed a Web App that predicts the sentiment of an user input review. <br>●Performed text cleaning and preprocessing including stemming, stopword removal, tokenization and HTML parsing for over 50,000 reviews and uploaded the transformed data to AWS S3. <br>●Built an LSTM model with Word Embedding layer using skip-gram architecture to learn sentiments from the data. <br>●Deployed the model for testing on AWS Sagemaker and achieved a test accuracy of 84%. <br>●Hosted the model on my Web App using AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway.
